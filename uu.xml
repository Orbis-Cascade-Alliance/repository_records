      <nwda:visitation>All collections held in Special Collections are available to the public. The department's finding aids are accessible online. Special Collections holdings do not circulate, often because of the rarity or value of the item, but primarily to ensure that researchers will have ready access to them. Professional librarians and archivists are available to assist users. The Special Collections Reading Room is open 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Monday â€“ Friday and 9:15 AM - 6:00 PM on Saturdays.
